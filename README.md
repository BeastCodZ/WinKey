## What is WinKey?

WinKey is an Electron based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) app designed to provide a clean, aesthetic, and easy to use experience for generating Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP). This lightweight desktop authenticator simplifies the process of securing your online accounts with an elegant interface and reliable token generation.

## ✨ What’s New in v2
  - **Google Drive Sync** — backup & restore your secrets with a click.
  - **Improved UI** — more aesthetic, smoother interaction.
  - **Basic backup system** — local and remote backups before overwriting.
  - **Clean multi-user codebase (experimental)** — prepping for multiple accounts.

## 🚧 Roadmap / Coming Soon

- Encryption for stored secrets — so your secrets.json is useless to thieves.
- bcrypt — hashed local passwords to guard your local database.
- GitHub login option — log in with your GitHub account.
- Fully-fledged multi-account login — switch between different cloud accounts seamlessly.

## Heads-up: Known issues

- **No encryption on stored secrets.**  
  Handle your `secrets.json` like it’s gold. If someone gets it, they get your keys.  
  Find your secrets.json here:  
  `C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\winkey`

- **No auto backups.**  
  Make sure to sync manually for now. Automatic backup in V3.
